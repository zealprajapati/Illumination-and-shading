To do the coloring on the object surface to make a more realistic 3D look.There are three types of illumination models: diffuse, ambient, and phong terms. So
to apply these three illumination principles to generate a plausible RGB color for each 3D unit. Since the
bunny object consists of multiple triangles. For this assignment,I used the flat shading mode to render the
Bunny object. In other word, the shading unit is a triangle. All the surface points from the same triangle have the
same RGB color.
Correct keyboard callback function to switch between different views.
hit “0” to show the Bunny with no shading at all (a single color for all the triangles).
- hit “1” to show the Bunny with only diffuse and ambient terms. The result looks like a plaster
material.
- hit “2” to show the Bunny with diffuse, ambient, and phong terms. The result may look like different
types of materials, depending on your choice of the exponential p for the phong terms, e.g. china
material (p = [55, 100], metal material p = [0.1, 1.0]).
- hit key “M” or “m" only to show the mesh lines (no triangle surface).
